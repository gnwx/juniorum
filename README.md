# Juniorum
The main goal of the application is to create opportunities for junior developers or internships for computer science students. The application only caters to one experience level, which is junior, and employees cannot register on the platform. Companies can create a profile and post their job listings.

**Overall**

In the process of building this app, my primary focus was on user interactions and feedback. To assist with this, I utilized the Material-UI (MUI) library, specifically the `Snackbar` and `Dialog` components, to provide users with notifications and feedback on their actions within the app. Additionally, I created custom hooks for converting photos to Base64 format and company register/login actions etc...

I used sessionStorage to avoid spending too much time on implementing complex security measures. However, I am aware that this is not a robust solution and that proper security measures should be implemented on the backend as well. It is important to note that my main goal in creating this app was to gain experience in improving UI and user experience (UX), rather than to learn about security measures.
